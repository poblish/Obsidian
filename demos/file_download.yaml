# FIXME Should make a better test e.g. using HAR analysis

Deploy a folder of static resources for HTTP:
- jetty:config: {port: 9877}
- jetty:deploy: {from: demos/static_pages, to: /static}

- url: "${Home}/static/ok_links.html"
- waitFor: "#download"
# Don't actually click

# Work out what the download is...
- set link: "attr( #download ).href()"
- set fullName: ${link}  # Should be superfluous
- set fileName: "extract( ${fullName}, '/([^/]*)$')"

# ... HTTP-get it, and check the GET matches what it should have been
- waitFor: {that: 'http:GET(${link}).content()', equals: {'file:demos/static_pages/${fileName}', 'Hello, Wold!'}}
