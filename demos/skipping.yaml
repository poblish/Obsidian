set:
  initial: ${randomInt()}
  x:       ${initial}

Skip mutation of 'x', way 1:
- skip:
- set x: 0

Skip mutation of 'x', way 2:
- skip: true
- set x: 0

Skip mutation of 'x', way 3:
- skip: yes
- set x: 0

Skip mutation of 'x', way 4:
- skip: 1
- set x: 0

Check 'x' didn't get changed after all:
- assert: {that: "${x}", eq: "${initial}"}

Now, finally don't skip:
- skip: FALSE
- set x: 0

Check 'x' finally did get changed:
- assert: {that: "${x}", eq: 0}
